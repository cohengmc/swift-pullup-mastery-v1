## üèãÔ∏è Pull Up Mastery Program

This document converts the "Pull Up Mastery" program details into a structured format for easy understanding and processing.

### Program Overview and Prerequisites
* **Program Title:** Pull Up Mastery
* **Fitness Prerequisites:** 5-12 Pull Ups
* **Equipment Requirement:** Pull Up Bar
* **Program Duration:** 6-12+ Weeks
* **About The Program:**
    * It has been used for nearly a decade.
    * It was developed while working with **elite Military and Law Enforcement personnel**.
    * It combines **3 powerful modalities** for rapidly improving pull up numbers.
    * It is ideally suited for those with **limited training time**, moderate pull up proficiency, and **3 non-consecutive days per week** to commit to training.

### The Training Templates

#### Standard Training Template

| Day | Max Day (Day 1) | Sub Max Volume (Day 2) | Ladder Volume (Day 3) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sets** | 3 (Max Effort) | 10 (50% Starting Max) | 5 (Ascending Ladder Sets) |
| **Rest** | 5:00+ | 1:00 Strict | 0:30 Strict |

#### Taper Template (For Fitness Assessments)
* For preparation for a fitness assessment, a proper taper is needed to dissipate fatigue.
* **Tapering** involves **reducing training volume by roughly 50%** in the week preceding the testing date.
* Maintain **48 hours** between your last training session and the assessment.

| Day | Max Day | Sub-Max Volume | Ladder Volume |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sets** | 2 (Max Effort) | 5 (50% Day 1 Max) | 2 (Ascending Ladder Sets) |
| **Rest** | 5:00+ | 1:00 Strict | 30 sec Strict |

### Program Details by Day

#### 1. Day 1 (Max Day)
* **Sets/Reps:** Perform **3 max effort sets** of pull ups.
* **Rest:** Rest times between max sets should be **at least 5 minutes**.
* **Form Standards:**
    * For testing prep, perform reps the way you will be tested and terminate when reps no longer meet the technical standard.
    * For recreational use, set a repetition standard (full ROM, chin over the bar, no kipping, etc.) and terminate the set when reps fail to meet that quality standard.

#### 2. Day 2 (Sub-Max Volume)
* **Target Reps:** Determined by your best set on your first max day. Take **50% of your best set** (round up if needed).
* **Execution:** Perform **10 sets** with a **STRICT 60-second rest** between sets.
    * You will likely be unable to perform all 10 sets at the target reps; complete as many reps as you can with good form and strict rest.
    * *Example:* If max was 10 reps (50% is 5), a first day might look like 5/5/5/5/5/4/3/3/3/2.
* **Progression:**
    * In subsequent weeks, try to **add reps to the incomplete sets**.
    * Stay with the same target set/rep scheme until you are able to achieve the target volume (e.g., all 10 sets of 5 reps).
    * Once the target volume is achieved, **increase the target reps per set by 1**.
    * This sub-max workout is progressed **independently** from the max day after the initial volume target is set.

#### 3. Day 3 (Ascending Ladders)
* **Objective:** Perform a large amount of high quality reps while periodically approaching high effort.
* **Execution:**
    * A ladder is a series of sets, each increasing in reps, with a **strict 30-second rest** between sets.
    * Start with **1 rep**, rest 30 seconds, then **2 reps**, rest 30 seconds, and so on.
    * Continue increasing reps by 1 until you are confident you won't complete the next set.
    * When a high level of effort is required to complete a set, rest 30 seconds and then perform a single rep to begin the next ladder.
    * **Total Volume:** You will perform **5 of these ladders**.
    * If you **fail a set**, the ladder is over; rest 30 seconds and start the next ladder with 1 rep.
* **Progression:** Gauge progress by going higher in the ladder, seeing increased consistency across the 5 ladders, or by taking a look at the **total reps** achieved with all 5 ladders.

### Other Program Considerations
* It is generally advised to **discourage the addition of extra upper body pulling movements** as this is a pull up specialization cycle.
* The program can be run in conjunction with a push up specialization cycle or another resistance training program.
* Pull ups are a display of **relative strength**; decreases in body fat can lead to improvement.
* If you are carrying suboptimal body fat, adding **cardio** and **proper dietary modifications** can dramatically increase the program's effectiveness.
